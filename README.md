# PengVision 

An AI-powered toolkit for architects to visualize, analyze, and present building designs. Simply upload a photo of a building, and PengVision will generate a complete suite of architectural assets.

##  Features

-   **Image Upload**: Start by uploading a JPG, PNG, or WEBP photo of a building.
-   **Architectural Portfolio Generator**: Automatically creates a professional portfolio with multiple views:
    -   3D Block Model
    -   Photorealistic Night Render
    -   Conceptual Floor Plans
    -   Artistic Design Sketches
    -   Technical Elevation Drawings
    -   Detailed Close-up Sketches
    -   Aerial, Side, Ant's Eye, and Interior Views
-   **Aerial View & Analysis**: Generates a photorealistic aerial view and then provides a detailed textual analysis of the building's architecture based on that new perspective.
-   **AI Narrator & Views**: Produces a series of four distinct, artistic views (Aerial, Side, Ant's Eye, Interior) and generates a compelling narration script to accompany them, complete with a text-to-speech audio file.
-   **Downloadable Assets**: All generated images and text analyses can be downloaded individually or as a `.zip` archive.

##  Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, no-build-step frontend stack.

-   **Framework**: [React 18](https://reactjs.org/)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **AI**: [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/docs/gemini_api_overview)
    -   `gemini-2.5-flash-image` for all image generation tasks.
    -   `gemini-2.5-pro` for textual analysis and script generation.
    -   `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts` for text-to-speech audio generation.
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (via CDN)
-   **Packaging**: [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) for creating downloadable `.zip` archives.
-   **Environment**: Runs directly in the browser using ES Modules and an `importmap` in `index.html`. No `npm`, `yarn`, or build tools like Vite/Webpack are required.

##  Getting Started

To run this project, you need a valid Google Gemini API key and a simple local web server.

### 1. API Key Setup

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function.

1.  **Get an API Key**: Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to create your API key.
2.  **Enable APIs**: Ensure the project associated with your API key has the **Generative AI API** (also sometimes listed as the Vertex AI API) enabled in the Google Cloud Console. This is necessary for all the generative features to work.
3.  **Set Environment Variable**: The application is designed to read the API key from an environment variable named `API_KEY`.
    -   If you are running this in a cloud development environment like Google AI Studio's Web IDE, find the "Secrets" or "Environment Variables" panel and create a new secret named `API_KEY` with your key as the value.
    -   If running locally, you will need a way to serve the files while making this variable available to the browser context. The easiest way is often to run it in an environment that handles this for you.

### 2. Running the Project

Since this project does not have a build step, you can run it using any simple local web server.

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository**: Get all the project files onto your local machine.
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and `cd` into the project folder.
3.  **Start a Local Server**: Run one of the following commands:

    **Using Python:**
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

    **Using Node.js (with `serve` package):**
    ```bash
    # Install serve globally if you don't have it
    npm install -g serve
    # Run the server
    serve .
    ```

    **Using VS Code:**
    -   Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.
    -   Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

4.  **Open in Browser**: Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).
